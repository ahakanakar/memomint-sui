## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd memomint-sui
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## How It Works

### 1. Sign In
Users authenticate using zkLogin, a privacy-preserving authentication method on Sui that doesn't require traditional wallet extensions.

### 2. Write Journal Entry
After signing in, users can write their daily journal entries in a clean, distraction-free interface.

### 3. AI Analysis
The built-in AI analyzer processes the journal entry and categorizes it based on keyword detection:
- **Victorious**: Achievement, success, and celebration
- **Diligent**: Hard work, learning, and progress
- **Reflective**: Contemplation, emotions, and introspection

### 4. Mint NFT
Each journal entry can be minted as a unique NFT on the Sui blockchain, creating a permanent, verifiable record of your journey.

## AI Sentiment Analysis

The sentiment analysis uses a keyword-based approach with three categories:

```javascript
analyzeJournal(entryText) => 'Victorious' | 'Diligent' | 'Reflective'
```

The function analyzes text for specific keywords associated with each sentiment and returns the dominant category.

## Development Status

### ✅ Completed
- Project scaffolding with React + Vite
