# Debug Enoki Client Issue

## Current Error

```
Authentication Error: enokiClient.getAuthorizationUrl is not a function
```

## Debug Steps Implemented

The code now logs the available methods on the EnokiClient. To debug:

### 1. Open Browser Console

Open Developer Tools (F12) and go to the Console tab.

### 2. Click "Sign in with Google"

You should see these debug logs:

```
EnokiClient type: object
EnokiClient methods: [list of method names]
EnokiClient own properties: [list of properties]
```

### 3. Check the Console Output

Look at what methods are actually available and send me that list.

## Possible Scenarios

### Scenario A: Method has different name

The method might be:
- `createAuthorizationUrl` (camelCase)
- `getAuthUrl` (shorter)
- `createAuthUrl`
- Part of a sub-object like `enokiClient.auth.createAuthorizationUrl`

### Scenario B: Wrong SDK Usage

We might need to use the SDK differently. Some possibilities:

#### Option 1: EnokiFlow Pattern
```javascript
import { EnokiFlow } from '@mysten/enoki/react';

const flow = new EnokiFlow({
  apiKey: enokiConfig.apiKey,
});

const authUrl = flow.createAuthorizationURL({
  provider: 'google',
  redirectUrl: enokiConfig.redirectUrl,
});
```

#### Option 2: ZkLogin Provider Pattern
```javascript
import { ZkLoginProvider } from '@mysten/enoki';

const provider = new ZkLoginProvider({
  apiKey: enokiConfig.apiKey,
});
```

#### Option 3: Direct OAuth (Manual)
If Enoki doesn't provide the auth URL directly, we might need to construct it manually.

## Next Steps

After you see the console output with available methods:

1. **Share the console output** - Tell me what methods are listed
2. **Check the SDK version** - Run: `npm list @mysten/enoki`
3. **Check the package README** - Look at: `node_modules/@mysten/enoki/README.md`

## Quick Check Commands

Run these in your terminal to help debug:

```bash
# Check Enoki version
npm list @mysten/enoki

# Check if README exists
cat node_modules/@mysten/enoki/README.md

# Check package.json for the package
cat node_modules/@mysten/enoki/package.json
```

## Alternative: Manual OAuth Implementation

If Enoki doesn't provide the OAuth URL, we can implement zkLogin manually. This would involve:

1. Generating a nonce
2. Constructing the Google OAuth URL with zkLogin parameters
3. Using the Enoki API only for the callback processing

Would you like me to implement this manual approach?

## What to Send Me

Please copy and paste the console output when you click "Sign in with Google". Specifically:

1. The "EnokiClient methods:" line
2. The "EnokiClient own properties:" line
3. Any error messages

This will help me provide the exact fix for your Enoki SDK version.
