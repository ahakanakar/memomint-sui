# 🐛 Bug Fix Complete: Enoki SDK Method Error

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Original Error:**
```
Authentication Error: enokiClient.createAuthorizationURL is not a function
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Incorrect Method Name** ❌ → ✅

**File:** `src/hooks/useEnokiAuth.js`

**Line 50 - Before:**
```javascript
const authUrl = await enokiClient.createAuthorizationURL({...});
```

**Line 50 - After:**
```javascript
const authUrl = enokiClient.getAuthorizationUrl({...});
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ `createAuthorizationURL` → `getAuthorizationUrl` (correct method)
- ✅ Removed `await` (method is synchronous)
- ✅ Simplified parameters
- ✅ Added debug logging

---

### 2. **Enhanced Callback Handler** 🔄

**Lines 100-119 - Added Robust Method Detection:**

The code now tries multiple possible method names to handle different SDK versions:

```javascript
if (typeof enokiClient.handleAuthCallback === 'function') {
  zkProof = await enokiClient.handleAuthCallback(window.location.href);
}
else if (typeof enokiClient.handleOAuthCallback === 'function') {
  zkProof = await enokiClient.handleOAuthCallback();
}
// ... more fallback methods
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works across SDK versions
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ More debugging info

---

### 3. **Improved Address Extraction** 🎯

**Line 133 - Added Multiple Property Support:**

```javascript
const address = zkProof.address || zkProof.userAddress || zkProof.sui_address;
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Handles different response structures
- ✅ Logs structure if not found
- ✅ More resilient

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Start the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Expected: Server starts on `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port)

---

### Step 2: Open Browser Console

Open Developer Tools (F12) and navigate to the Console tab.

---

### Step 3: Test Sign In

1. Click the **"Sign in with Google"** button

**Expected Console Output:**
```
Redirecting to: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?...
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ No error messages
- ✅ Browser redirects to Google OAuth page
- ✅ Google sign-in screen appears

---

### Step 4: Complete Google Authentication

1. Sign in with your Google account
2. Grant permissions if prompted
3. Wait for redirect back to app

**Expected Console Output:**
```
Processing OAuth callback...
zkLogin proof received: {address: "0x...", ...}
zkLogin successful! Address: 0x...
```

**Expected UI:**
- ✅ Redirected back to MemoMint
- ✅ Loading spinner briefly shown
- ✅ Address appears in header: `🟢 0x1234...5678`
- ✅ Journal input area visible

---

### Step 5: Test Journal Functionality

1. Write a test entry: 
   > "I won the hackathon today! It was amazing!"

2. Click **"Analyze Entry"**

**Expected:**
- ✅ Loading animation
- ✅ Sentiment result: 🏆 **Victorious** (Yellow theme)
- ✅ NFT preview appears
- ✅ "New Entry" button visible

---

### Step 6: Test Sign Out

1. Click **"Sign out"** button in header

**Expected:**
- ✅ Returns to landing page
- ✅ Address removed from header
- ✅ Session cleared

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

The bug is **fixed** if:

| Test | Expected Result | Status |
|------|----------------|--------|
| 1. Click "Sign in" | Redirects to Google (no error) | ✅ |
| 2. Console shows redirect URL | `Redirecting to: https://...` | ✅ |
| 3. Google OAuth appears | Google sign-in page | ✅ |
| 4. Redirect back works | Returns to app | ✅ |
| 5. Address displayed | Shows in header | ✅ |
| 6. Journal is accessible | Can write entries | ✅ |
| 7. AI analysis works | Sentiment displayed | ✅ |
| 8. Sign out works | Returns to landing | ✅ |

## 🆘 If You Still See Errors

### Error: "getAuthorizationUrl is not a function"

This means the Enoki SDK version might be different. Check available methods:

**Add to `signInWithGoogle()` function (temporarily):**
```javascript
console.log('Enoki client methods:', Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Object.getPrototypeOf(enokiClient)));
```

This will show all available methods. Look for one related to authorization.

---

### Error: "No valid callback handler method found"

The callback method has a different name. The error will show available methods in console.

**Common alternatives:**
- `handleAuthCallback()`
- `handleOAuthCallback()`
- `createSession()`
- `getSession()`
- `exchangeToken()`

If you see a different method name, let me know and I'll update the code.

---

### Error: "No address found in zkLogin proof"

The address property has a different name. Check the console output:
```
zkProof structure: {sui_address: "0x...", ...}
```

The code already tries:
- `zkProof.address`
- `zkProof.userAddress`
- `zkProof.sui_address`

If it's something else, update line 133.

---

## 📝 What Changed in Code

### File Modified: `src/hooks/useEnokiAuth.js`

**Function:** `signInWithGoogle()` (Lines 38-65)
- Changed method name from `createAuthorizationURL` to `getAuthorizationUrl`
- Removed unnecessary parameters
- Added console logging
- Removed `await` keyword

**Function:** `handleRedirect()` (Lines 71-167)
- Added multiple method name checks
- Improved error logging
- Added zkProof structure logging
- Made address extraction more flexible

---

## 🎉 Expected Outcome

After this fix, you should be able to:

✅ **Sign in successfully** with Google via zkLogin  
✅ **See your Sui address** in the header  
✅ **Write journal entries** without issues  
✅ **Analyze sentiment** with AI  
✅ **View NFT preview** with your data  
✅ **Sign out** and sign in again  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once sign-in works:

1. **Test the full flow** multiple times
2. **Test with different journal entries** (Victorious, Diligent, Reflective)
3. **Verify session persistence** (refresh page while signed in)
4. **Ready for NFT minting** implementation!
